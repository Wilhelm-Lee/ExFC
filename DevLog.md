Now working on:  
____ Considering adding file "src/catcher.h" & file "src/catcher.c"  
____ Reason:  
____ ____ Having an exception thrown and ending the thread directly is not  
____ ____ __ ideal or safe.  
____ ____ Now suppose we could catch the specified exception and redirect
the  
____ ____ __ flow to target function could make throwing an exception  
____ ____ __ much more sensible.  
Finished:  
____ Basic readings and writings for exceptions.  
More to be done:  
____ Now [Carnival](https://github.com/WilliamPascal/Carnival) is bound to be
used in [JCCL](https://github.com/JackCraftTeam/JackCraftCommodoreLauncher).  
____ Not only JCCL is based on terminology, Carnival is born for terminals,  
____ __ but also, during the whole process of these two projects, I've
discoverd  
____ __ that, C & C++ has the most flexibilities towards low-level
technologies  
____ __ crediting to GNU/GCC and GNU/G++. (of course, they were born for it)
