Now working on:  
$~~~~$ Considering adding file "src/catcher.h" & file "src/catcher.c"  
$~~~~$ Reason:  
$~~~~$ $~~~~$ Having an exception thrown and ending the thread directly is not  
$~~~~$ $~~~~$ $~~$ ideal or safe.  
$~~~~$ $~~~~$ Now suppose we could catch the specified exception and redirect
the  
$~~~~$ $~~~~$ $~~$ flow to target function could make throwing an exception  
$~~~~$ $~~~~$ $~~$ much more sensible.  
Finished:  
$~~~~$ Basic readings and writings for exceptions.  
More to be done:  
$~~~~$ Now [Carnival](https://github.com/WilliamPascal/Carnival) is bound to be
used in [JCCL](https://github.com/WilliamPascal/JackCraftCommodoreLauncher).  
$~~~~$ Not only JCCL is based on terminology, Carnival is born for terminals,  
$~~~~$ $~~$ but also, during the whole process of these two projects, I've
discoverd  
$~~~~$ $~~$ that, C & C++ has the most flexibilities towards low-level
technologies  
$~~~~$ $~~$ crediting to GNU/GCC and GNU/G++. (of course, they were born for it)
